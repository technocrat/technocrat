The prominence of FICO in home loan credit underwriting described in the Pinto Testimony had its origins in a different time (the early 1990s) and a different lending environment. Freddie Mac was in a good position to ensure that all other things were equal. It made only what came to be called “prime” loans, generally for no more than 80% of the value of the property, under more stringent limitations on the debt-to-income ratio of the borrower and many other criteria that it kept within a narrow range, and offered only a few varieties of loans. In the subprime market that emerged in the late 90s, all of those factors changed. Criteria that were narrow became broad, documentation was relaxed and a widespread assumption was that continually rising home values would preclude any problems. It’s not surprising that FICO lost its predictive power. 5.2 Restructuring the data Some of the testing of FICO as a useful metric involved subsetting the data. There were many more variables than the ones used, some of them categorical and some categorical coded as numeric. One potentially useful variable is location, because we know that real estate value are location sensitive. We have four location fields in the database, all derived from the postal zip code: The zip code itself, which is generally either much smaller or much larger than the real estate market, and also changes at the convenience of the postal service. See the discussion at [On the use of ZIP codes and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) for the spatial analysis of epidemiological data]. The metropolitan area derived from the U.S. Census ZIP code tabulation area, but covers a larger area than most real estate markets Longitude and latitude dervived from the ZCTA’s, used for mapping As a compromise, I converted the 5-digit zip codes into 3-digit zip codes. In metropolitan areas, the 3-digit codes are the sizes comparable to how the multiple listing services divide the market. We’ll see if there is any value in this proxy measure of real estate market. It was time to reorganize the database into a more streamlined version, that captured the information on performance (relieving the 11-month constraint) and transformed the fields that needed to be treated as categorical, rather than continuous. It’s much more efficient to put this in a new SQL table than to keep in memory, especially since sampling will be involved. Here’s the revised data layout: MariaDB [dlf]&gt; describe loans; +-----------+--------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | +-----------+--------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | row_names | text | YES | | NULL | | | ctapeno | double | YES | | NULL | | | deal | text | YES | | NULL | | | fico | double | YES | | NULL | | | dti | double | YES | | NULL | | | cltv | double | YES | | NULL | | | obal | double | YES | | NULL | | | orate | double | YES | | NULL | | | grade | text | YES | | NULL | | | dtype | text | YES | | NULL | | | fpd | text | YES | | NULL | | | ltype | text | YES | | NULL | | | pmiflag | text | YES | | NULL | | | ppp | text | YES | | NULL | | | otype | text | YES | | NULL | | | purpose | text | YES | | NULL | | | ptype | text | YES | | NULL | | | zip | text | YES | | NULL | | | perf | text | YES | | NULL | | +-----------+--------+------+-----+---------+-------+ 19 rows in set (0.00 sec) Between the first two rows (record identifiers) and the last row (the performance category) are the 17 variables we have to predict the performance outcome. For the almost 100,000 records, that is 1.7 million pieces of information. Technically we are in 17-dimensional space, and we need a way of flattening the dimensionality to be able to question the data. 5.3 Principal component analysis The cumulative variance is 0.262, 0.495, 0.704, 0.86, 1 for this sample of 300. From the loadings chart on the right, we see that obal (the original amount of the loan) and orate (the original rate of interest) are negatively correlated, -0.451. The remaining continuous variables, fico, dti (debt-to-income ratio), cltv (the ratio of first and second loans to the value of the mortgaged property), have small correlations: The variables fico and cltv have some correlation (0.295), while fico and dti (-0.036) and dti and cltv (0.121) have low correlations. The variable orate, however, is clearly discrete, so we re-run without it and increase the size of the sample to 9,000. The variances are [1] 0.2885885 0.2653345 0.2508713 0.1952057 5.4 K-means clustering The following represents the unsupervised classification of the fico, cltv, obal, and dti of an approximately 10% samplefrom the loans dataset. Using the entire population, rather than a sample creates somewhat better defined clusters K-means clustering of all loans in loans database Consideration might be given to separately clustering high-balance loans. Other outliers, such as the zero FICO scores, can be safely ignored, as can be the anomalous loan with a 97% dti ratio. "]
