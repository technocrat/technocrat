Description: In cases in which population data analysis fails to yield 
    sub-populations that differ in non-obvious ways. A helpful initial step
    may be to repeat an original population analysis on several subsets. To 
    avoid cut-and-paste errors or methodologial drift, a package can help
    assure consistency.
